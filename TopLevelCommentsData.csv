0,ios,"I really like that now there are colored indicators in Calendar month view. Unfortunately, there are no widgets that show them. ¬†",81
1,ios,"**Control Center:**  
I'm not a big fan of the new Control Center. Closing it feels trickier now‚Äîyou have to swipe up from the bottom, which isn‚Äôt as smooth. It also lags sometimes, which can be frustrating.

The large padding around everything is a bit too much for me. Plus, I really wish they offered separate toggles instead of bundling all the connectivity options together. It would make things a lot easier!

**Photos:**  
It takes a bit to get used to the new Photos app, but honestly, it‚Äôs smoother and finding things is easier. However, I‚Äôm not loving the album cards. They‚Äôre just too big, but the thumbnails are too small, it‚Äôs hard to recognise the images quickly.

Also, the photo and video previews are too small and everything feels a bit cramped.",37
2,ios,"Was looking forward to the ability to place icons anywhere on the Home Screen, but it is horribly implemented. If you try to move an icon to an open spot on your Home Screen that is above where it currently is, it moves around and completely messes up all your other icons. It‚Äôs almost like they‚Äôre using invisible spacers in the background.",55
3,ios,"I like it a lot and it‚Äôs an update I‚Äôm more excited about compared to the previous iOS versions. I didn‚Äôt use the beta, so today was the first day I used it. Lots of nice little features üëç",18
4,ios,"so far it seems like a solid update. Bit light on the new stuff but eh, there‚Äôs only so much you can still add.",38
5,ios,"Using iPhone 12. Don‚Äôt think things have changed a lot. Photos App is fine. Control Center has become weird and seems clogged. Phone feels slower. Simple things like T9 dialling are welcome. 

Doesn‚Äôt really appear to be much of an upgrade.",18
6,ios,"Not a lot of new features but super welcome additions like bilingual keyboard and improved photos search.
Also, being able to do math easily everywhere is insane and super useful.

I have an iPhone 11 and it suffered a lot from keyboard freezing in ios17. Now, although they keyboard may lag sometimes, it never freezes.

So for me ios 18 is better than 17 already. But o haven‚Äôt faced any major bug, just minor ones like video playback on photos app sometimes can‚Äôt get past 1 second",17
7,ios,"As someone who isn‚Äôt really the customization type, it‚Äôs a little boring. Haven‚Äôt noticed any issues yet though, so I can‚Äôt really complain.",17
8,ios,Rcs ftw,31
9,ios,I hate the photos update with a passion.,12
10,ios,Made my iPhone 11 so much smoother,18
11,ios,I love it . Some small additions like hiding distracting items in safari is amazing :.. no more soft paywalls,8
12,ios,"There's some UI stuff I'm not thrilled about, especially since the wallpaper doesn't blur on the Today view or App Library anymore. It's minor, but I don't like that being treated as part of the Home Screen. There's another weird bug that's apparently been around for a while where you can't use the ""plus"" button on Messages when sharing something from the Share Sheet.",7
13,ios,Calculators update is great for me!!,6
14,ios,Give it two or three weeks for all the bugs to be discovered. iOS 17 was a train wreck for months. Hopefully 18 is better.,6
15,ios,Buggier than I expected,5
16,ios,They added the one feature I always thought was need but never heard anyone speak about. Being able to type the first few letters of a contacts name or number on the keypad to bring the relevant contact. Was a feature that some androids had over a decade ago when I used both platforms. And I had always missed having that on ios.,5
17,ios,"I had to add a dedicated Mobile Data switch in Control Center to bypass that terribly designed connectivity hub; I haven‚Äôt touched my home screen layout since widgets came out and I‚Äôve found no need to fiddle with it this time; dark icons look bad imo; the Photos app I was quick to get used to, I‚Äôm actually happy with the redesign as it allowed me to remove all the bloated BS of the Photos app. No more auto generated memories, featured photos etc; Reminders integration in Calendar is a godsend, and would be my personal highlight of the entire update, it‚Äôs way more useful than rearranging icons.",5
18,ios,pretty smooth so far.,5
19,ios,Got some heating issues but they will pass. I am too busy playing with Screen mirroring. Mac and watch also got updates at the same time. Yes I know Android has had link to windows and app locking for ever - but not having to get my phone out to even turn it on is brill. So much easier on the train now to just access my phone through the laptop. Loving it so far,4
20,ios,So good so far,4
21,ios,Jokes aside - Safari is definitely snappier,3
22,ios, Always turning on airdrop instead of mobile data because someone thought it‚Äôs better to hide data inside the folder,5
23,ios,"Honestly I think it has been over hyped because most of the talk about iOS 18 has been with AI and well we don‚Äôt have it yet, So maybe it will be better once 18.1 releases but until then I‚Äôll play around with it",4
24,ios,Vehicle motion cues ... Shit its incredible. Its my biggest problem in vehicle. Now i think about iphone  from pixel.,4
25,ios,"I‚Äôm very disappointed, especially With new control center, calculator, reachability, photos, Eye tracking, there are some good things, but overall nothing special. Somethings even worse., and all that  not even mention siri is still the same old stupid siri",7
26,ios,Ehhhh - don‚Äôt like the photos app.  Didn‚Äôt like it before.  Like it less now.  The new Control panel is messy.  Is there anything else?,7
27,ios,Been on it since dev beta and it's really lackluster,3
28,ios,I like iOS 18... the better customisability of the icons and the home screen alone are worth it. No bugs found so far.,3
29,ios,"Many functions are hidden or less than obvious than you would think , been using it now for many months through the beta testing.",3
30,ios,I am patiently waiting for 18.2. My iPhone and iPad work fine as they are.,3
31,ios,"I got my first iPhone this summer and the only thing I really missed from my pixel was Google calendar. I‚Äôve been using Google calendar on my iPhone, but when I heard iOS 18 was updating the calendar app I was excited to finally be able to ditch Google. And I really love the new calendar app! 

I haven‚Äôt had much time to check everything else out, but I have noticed group texts don‚Äôt seem to be working right. I have a group chat with 2 other people, one has an iPhone, the other an android. When I texted them last night and they each replied, the Android reply went to a separate chat with just the two of us, but the iPhone reply was in the group.",3
32,ios,I just wish eye scroll worked better. I turned it off after about ten minutes.,3
33,ios,"There are some serious bugs. I set the new iOS18 wallpaper, set it to 'dynamic' and also for the home screen to mirror the lock screen using the 'pair' option. Often the color on the lockscreen will change, but the color of the homescreen is still stuck on the previous color.

I also sometimes get app icons that don't display properly when apps are in folders. It's just a blank white box. When I click into the folder the app icons will display, but then when I close the folder, it's just a blank white box again. This has happened with quite a few apps.

Mixed feelings on the control center. I like how customizable it is and somewhat like the fact that all the connectivity stuff is on its own page. But then why also have it accessible from the widget thing that defaults to the top left? Why is airplay one of the options there and not cellular data? Yeah i know you can set an icon for cellular data but it's still a strange choice. 

Hate the circles in the control center. Much preferred the rounded-off squares from before.

Really like the new dark mode icons.

I actually like the new photos app. Especially since screenshots now have their own separate folder.",3
34,ios,Notes App is very unresponsive and freezes in my iPhone 15 Pro after updating to iOS 18.,3
35,ios,What do you mean downgrade? Since when is this possible?,3
36,ios,"Nothing changed. It‚Äôs the same. Why is it overhyped for nothing significant? Even in terms of aesthetics, nothing changed worth mentioning.",3
37,ios,"It's a meh..... in my perspective. Let's see what we got (at least I noticed):

Photo: I haven't got used to it, I think I need to spend some time on the customization. I still need to scroll down down down even after getting used to it. One big plus thing is the picture fitting, remember the buttons and info covering the picture? Not anymore, the picture will fit the viewable area and it looks great.

Calendar: I like it. I understand iPhone has a small screen, but displaying items as a freaking dot was so stupid, now I am able to see some texts and how many tasks on that day.

Phone mirroring: Not sure if I should put it here since It's working on MacOS, but It's garbage, super stupid to resize the window, lagging, not friendly with regular good old mouse. It looks like Apple was overly paranoid on the displaying quality, it looks sharp and cool, but unusable.

Pushing notification to Mac: Nice, I like it.

swipe down menu: trash. Photo requires a lot of customization, this menu provided too limited customization tolerance.... I like AirDrop, but why do I need an AirDrop button out up there?

Password on app: I don't think I will use it, but It's nice to have.",3
38,ios,"I was finally able to get rid of my invisible widget so my 2 rows of icons can live at the bottom the screen where my thumb is. That was probably the biggest thing I missed about my old jailbroken phone.  
I dig the dark mode icons. I dig the new dynamic background - the color changes have been nice to see!",3
39,ios,"What happened to the Today view when you swipe to the left from Home Screen? It used to be darkened and stuff and now it‚Äôs just another Home Screen, or is that just me?",3
40,ios,From my side really I can not understand why the have not make the option to order photos! I want the latest photos on top!,3
41,ios,Meh.,3
42,ios,I‚Äôm still using an Xs so it‚Äôs made my dying phone run smoother. The dark Home Screen makes my neurodivergent brain so happy. I‚Äôve customized the photos app so it‚Äôs not overwhelming and I‚Äôm actually happy with it now and the bilingual keyboard is a godsend for communicating with my mum who lives in Spain and we speak a lot of Spanglish.,3
43,ios,"Using an iPhone 13 Pro - I feel like my phone is a lot smoother now, also across apps in general. There seems to be less glitching and lagging and the animations are like butter. Photos app will take some getting used to, but it‚Äôs not terrible.",3
44,ios,"There are lot of under the hood small changes which make the whole experience even more immersive. I don‚Äôt know about others, but I have not experienced any issue, it‚Äôs very smooth. The real changes will come after 18.1, so question will be more relevant than.",3
45,ios,The way you move icons around is absolutely cooked. Terrible usability. No idea how that got past QA¬†,3
46,ios,"T9 dialling is really the only thing I have been waiting for. The dark theme possibilites on the home screen are nice though, and I really like being able to make all icpns bigger and remove thr typed out app name.",3
47,ios,"I remember having several freezes on different screens last night. I actually forgot about it until just now reading this post. I‚Äôve been working all day and haven‚Äôt even had a chance to be on my phone much today.  Overall, not extremely impressed yet.  Home screen customization still falls short of what I used to be able to do on android years ago.  Loving the fact that I can now pause video while recording!",3
48,ios,"Control Centre is half-baked. Why can‚Äôt I freely place buttons? It‚Äôs also very unpredictable as to where something will move if I want to move an adjacent button/widget. It‚Äôs frustrating. The animations when editing are also choppy and weird.

I deleted the dedicated pages because it didn‚Äôt work when they tried it in iOS 8-9 and it won‚Äôt work a decade later.

Safari is, in fact, snappier. So snappy that I keep accidentally closing tabs. It‚Äôs super responsive and everything just feels quick. I used iOS 7 recently on an ooooold iPhone and it was so ridiculously slow to navigate because of the wanky animations.",3
49,ios,"Who else is really excited about bilingual keyboards?!?

It was about time! Let‚Äôs see how it performs with predictions over time, but my ‚Äúnormal‚Äù keyboards from before were all messed up in predictions and autocorrection, because I ended up writing the wrong language on the wrong keyboard a lot since they were not remembering the last used keyboard per app and when in a rush I did not switch‚Ä¶ just type üòú",3
50,ios,"So far everything‚Äôs pretty good for me, the only problem I have with iOS 18 is that It screwed up the Notes app. It‚Äôs completely unusable right now and freezes when you try to click on your notes. Or it crashes after about 30 seconds to a minute after waiting for it to load. I‚Äôm hoping this gets fixed soon because the Notes app is very essential to my daily life (Educational Uses, Personal Use, Jobs, etc.)",3
51,ios,"Some slow downs here and there as well as some graphical glitches noticeably on the notification center, otherwise it works quite well. The new control panel is weird and not really well made, by default everything is compressed on top of the screen which looks funny, but it works. I like the subtle detail of screen pushing in on the volume buttons. Photos app is weird UI but I don‚Äôt use it so I don‚Äôt really care. I live in Europe so I don‚Äôt care either for RCS because everybody is using WhatsApp. Multilingual typing is finally here and it‚Äôs not bad ! 
Screen mirroring not available in Europe. So basically it‚Äôs a very light update",8
52,ios,"Pretty underwhelmed to be honest, there's nothing I find particularly helpful in this release, and I'm not a fan of the new Photos app. Rarely text anyone on Android (everyone I know uses WhatsApp) so RCS is no biggie, and I use Fantastical for my calendar (which Apple just seem to have copied from).

My phone was super smooth before and I don't see any change in performance in a good or bad way.

I'm in the UK so should get the AI features later, then I think it'll seem more worthwhile.",3
53,ios,"Well we've got a proper dark theme and conversion on the calculator now, so at the very least we have 10 year old Android features at long last.¬†",7
54,ios,"I think the only thing I‚Äôm not a fan of is the command center. I utilized it a lot in 17, and 18 really dropped the ball with it. I like that it‚Äôs more customizable, but it‚Äôs also worse at the same time? I dont have the AI capabilities with my 15, but I like the text features in messages, the new calendar options, unpopular opinion but I do like the new photos app, I just dont like the command center. 

I‚Äôm torn between downgrading or just getting used to 18.",2
55,ios,"No issues, really not much difference‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs fine",2
56,ios,"I thought the icons would be more customizable, not just an everything or nothing blue tint for example. Can‚Äôt even make each icon screen different colors.¬†",2
57,ios,The only thing I hate is that most apps don‚Äôt have dark themed icons.,2
58,ios,"Yes issues are there, for me I encountered homescreen layout not working as intended, little warmer to touch, can not set keyboard combo with my language. If your phone lang is not set to eng and if you reset your phone in last step you will see buttons with untranslated strings and overall I just find search  more useful the rest is nothing for me as half things will not work in my country/region. And at this moment I am getting to 17.7 as that was well rounded. I can live without all new things introduced with iOS 18 at the moment.",2
59,ios,I don‚Äôt have it yet. I‚Äôm on a iPhone 14. I‚Äôm still in 17.7 for some reason here in the us,2
60,ios,"I personally really waited for the customization features, and I‚Äôm not disappointed. It‚Äôs about time it was integrated on iPhone as well.",2
61,ios,"The new control center ui sucks, especially in landscape mode
The new photos app sucks
For some reason they decided to get rid of the blur on the App Library and widgets page along side the animation. 
Like why
The only positive thing i can think of is that dark mode icons look cool and match dark mode better. 
This update sucks overall",2
62,ios,"It's stuttery and laggy. And there's an abundance of new bugs, on top of all the old bugs Apple didn't fix.",2
63,ios,"Feels surprisingly snappy for a .0 release. I love the ability to make icons large and get rid of titles, but they seem almost TOO large. Whatever the percentage increase from small to large is, I wish they'd drop that by like 20-30%. Icons this big feel like a kids' phone.",2
64,ios,"15pm, control center seems like it got worse to organize.  stuff just lags out and disappears constantly and i have to leave the edit screen to make it appear again.  i also accidentally pull my second page down when using reachability a lot bc the way the screen goes back up after u do the swipe.  otherwise its not bad.",2
65,ios,"Overall, I like it. You can keep your phone exactly how it was or customize. It‚Äôs not in your face and I appreciate that. I like the pages option for control center, especially the connection one. Only issue is the icon customization is kind of beta feeling and my torch is using a metric assload of battery even though I only flicked it on for a second yesterday to test hardware after the update. Other than that, it‚Äôs just iOS with a few more options. Dig my most used apps being able to live at the bottom of the screen where I can reach them faster.",2
66,ios,"New update is kind of boring to me. I like the dark icons. I like that the control center can be customized. Customizable lock screen shortcuts. Reorganized settings app and passwords app. 

Don‚Äôt like- 
RCS isn‚Äôt available for everyone. My carrier (Google Fi) isn‚Äôt supported. No clue if it will be. 
There is no dedicated control center toggle for WiFi. Still only on the connectivity block. I like the option to customize but it seems half baked. 
Moving icons around on the home screen seems buggy. 
Overall underwhelming considering all the advertising of Apple intelligence and not having that at launch.",2
67,ios,Not even there on my daughters phone or the ipad so still cant get it on them weirdly i have it though i like it,2
68,ios,Missing Google Keep widget. Ridiculous,2
69,ios,best update so far,2
70,ios,Is the automatic icon theming not working for anyone? Mine is always dark no matter the time of day. Or is it only changing the wallpaper?,2
71,ios,I‚Äôm just about annoyed that Apple chose to not roll out Apple Intelligence to iPhone 15 and only iPhone 15 pros end up.I know there is a limitation of RAM that is the reasoning behind this but still I just find it really annoying. It takes most of the relevant new features away and leaves us only with new customizations options to home screen control center.I just find this new upgrade really boring. I hope Apple will choose to roll out Apple Intelligence to iPhone 15‚Äôs also.,2
72,ios,"I have been running iOS 18 since early dev beta.

I will not be downgrading to iOS 17",2
73,ios,It‚Äôs cool! But the hover feature  keeps getting stuck,2
74,ios,It's much more colorful which I like,2
75,ios,I don‚Äôt hate the new update. But I don‚Äôt love it either. The send text later feature is cool. But that‚Äôs about it.,2
76,ios,Is anyone having trouble sending photos through messages?,2
77,ios,"I like it so far, but mainly for the reorganization potential of the home, since apple intelligence isn‚Äôt available for me, this update seems very light compared to what was announced first.",2
78,ios,I don‚Äôt like features I can‚Äôt hide or ones that I can but are turned on by default. The search bar on my Home Screen was annoying but I can and have turned it off. The Hidden Apps folder is very frustrating because I will never have hidden apps and I don‚Äôt want it in my App Library so just let me hide it.,2
79,ios,"I‚Äôve been hoping for some significant improvements to the Mail app, like message categorization, but it‚Äôs still stuck with the same extreme simplicity as always. And it looks like any major enhancements will come through Apple Intelligence, which unfortunately won‚Äôt be available in Brazil for what seems like the next decade ü•∫. So, overall, I feel a bit let down by this update.",2
80,ios,So far I like it! No issues.,2
81,ios,I‚Äôm enjoying it more than I thought I would. Some bugs and battery draining faster than normal but I‚Äôm content.,2
82,ios,"I can finally italicize words in texts now, so I‚Äôm happy lol",2
83,ios,The only difference is that the Wi-Fi is unstable.,2
84,ios,I hate the photos app and control center,2
85,ios,Calendar seems slow to load when scrolling through in detailed view.,2
86,ios,"Idk if I'm crazy but if seems like my photos are coming out less clear after the update, especially in low light and when I zoom..",2
87,ios,"i feel battery life on my 15 pro is affected, its draining way too fast, anyone else facing the issue?",2
88,ios,"I was skeptical to go to 18 instead of just downloading 17.7 but I‚Äôm glad I made the decision for 18. I‚Äôm on the 15pro so can‚Äôt wait for the next update with new Siri and AI but in the meantime I haven‚Äôt had any issues. Battery was my biggest fear but it actually seems better than before now. Phone hasn‚Äôt heated up once like crazy like when I first got the phone and seems to be holding its charge longer. Most of the changes haven‚Äôt really been game changer for me personally but I do feel like my phone has been running smoother since the update and somehow texting has gotten better. Before it was messing up everything I was trying to type but now it never does. I‚Äôve been running it for about a day and a half now. Only complaint is the photo library and videos but I‚Äôve never really had that as a vocal part in my usage so it‚Äôs whatever to me. I‚Äôm sure future updates will tweak things a bit. Control panel was weird at first but after getting rid of some icons and adding new ones it feels the same as before. Calculator has been super fun to use and I‚Äôm sure ppl that actually need it for work will take advantage of it to its fullest, especially on iPads and with a pen. I just liked being able to draw 5+5= and getting the answer but even Reddit does that so not exactly groundbreaking haha. 

So for me no complaints, it seems to only have improved my phone and I haven‚Äôt had any glitches or lagginess. Even when running battery save mode it barely seemed to make apps or usage suffer like it did before. I ran it hard today with Instacart and DoorDash both running, constantly jumping between apps and opening maps and didn‚Äôt have a single problem. Only issue I had was when I went out to the boonies but I blame that on cell reception

This is on a 15pro though so I really can‚Äôt comment on people with older models and I‚Äôm sure it will make the phone work a bit harder resulting in lagginess or glitches 

PS. I‚Äôm pissed that they added the Shazam shortcut to the action button because I was so proud of myself for making a custom command to use Shazam and told all my friends to use the action button for it haha but great to see it was added in the update",2
89,ios,"I feel Apple is trending towards Android like theme and I don't like it, at all. The photo app sucks now and tbh the overall theme looks ultra weak and simple....",2

Quick tip: it‚Äôs easier to create duplicates (which is something I wouldn‚Äôt have expected to be possible) and then use these to move everything around and delete them later - so you don‚Äôt mess with what‚Äôs already in where you want it‚Ä¶

Also the multipage thing that is going on is not perfect yet. Page symbols (for example the favorites heart switches pages when you add icons on the page above - can‚Äôt replicate it now, but it was weird somehow)

All in all it is working, even though there is some weirdness to it, but it does not impact anything once you set it up so I am happy with the new possibilities right now and I believe they will enhance it and make it more clear in coming updates)",1
100,ios,My iPhone 15 pro seems laggy and some reason the service is poor,1
101,ios,"New features seem half baked for notes.   
1. **Recording feature** in notes is not very useful. It would be nice if the recording were linked to drawing or typing while recording, like the audio attached to notes in Goodnotes or Notability. Apple could have done even better as neither GN or Notability allow auto-scroll to the sketching/typing attached to the audio. 

I think OneNote does this but only for desktop or windows, not for iOS. 

2. **Lag in drawing** is significant after the update. I disabled all the auto-correction, etc, and it is still very very slow to draw and erase. Seems very rushed.",1

113,ios,Joined this community just to vent... experiencing a ton of bugs in ios 18 from siri to files app to the new homescreen customization. Photos app is absolutely horrendous as many have echoed. Extremely disappointing from Apple in the modern era especially considering I've just shelled out the money for the 16 Pro and they specifically halted release of Apple Intelligence to try to get the initial ios 18 and iPhone release right...  I would hardly consider what they've been putting out to be innovative in the last 5 years so you would think they could at least get a basic software update right,1
114,ios,"Apple did something that finally fixed the issue I had syncing music from my iPhone to my Apple Watch. If it wasn't intentional, it's some incredibly good dumb luck. I've had this problem from back with my iPhone SE 2016 and with an iPhone 14 Pro, and with 3 different AWs, a 6, 7 & Ultra. I had the same issue with every iOS and AW update. It was always one of the 1st thing I'd try after an update just to see lol.

Syncing music would work sometimes, other times it would just sit there, and even when it would work, any albums that would actually sync wouldn't show up in the Music section of the Watch App on my iPhone for what's on the watch. Also every time I opened the music section of the Watch app on my iPhone it would try to sync an album I had long removed my phone, even if I swiped in the app and said to delete it, it would just keeping trying over and over. 

It's still mind numbingly slow, like it took maybe half an hour, or longer to sync 1 album. But the fact it synced it and it's showing up in the album list is somewhat of a miracle.  I don't want to jinx it, but having tried this on 2 phones and 3 watches with like 6 different iOS/watchOS versions, and resetting both the phone and watch numerous times trying to fix it. I'm assuming it works now.  I gave up trying after about 50 attempts, it's never worked like this for me. I just tried today for shits and giggles to see what would happen.


Now I don't believe Apple cared at all, this probably wasn't something they purpously fixed.  So I hope it doesn't break again with something they change in the next update lol.  It would be nice is if it was I dunno, faster than dial up modem speeds, but it I let it run for a few days I'll have the music on the watch. I remember reading somewhere they limit the music on the watch to 8GB so I can't put too much anywho.

If anyone actually read this and is wondering what exactly I'm talking about, it's all music I synced to my phone with iTunes on my PC.",1
115,ios,Sucks for now.,1
116,ios,I would revert back to iOS 17 if I could.,1
117,ios,Short anser: I don't like it at all. The same goes for the new Mac OS.,1
118,ios,Been on it thru the betas and have enjoyed it‚Ä¶ other then WHY APPLE. Why??? Did you have to butcher the photo app.,1

120,ios,Got it and can barely tell any difference tbh. Almost looking for something worthwhile that has changed. ‚ÄúMeh‚Äù,1
121,ios,I hate the new control center so much and now my iphone XS dies 1.5x as fast and charges 1.5x slower,1
122,ios,I didnt find much of a change. One of the most boring updates I have seen.,1
123,ios,"Okay, first time owning an iPhone and  looking at a new update. This looks like a joke as a ex-Android user. What did they add??? you can color your icons, which makes them look terrible in my opinion, you can kindoff place your icons where you want on the screen. As long as their or no other icons near it because then the whole background is fucked again‚Ä¶ Litterly every single thing that was added to IOS existed on Androide +5 years ago. And is way simpler and waaaaaaaaay cheaper‚Ä¶ I dont get why people would choose IOS over Android. I am stunnes",1
124,ios,It‚Äôs awful. I‚Äôm wiping my phone and restoring ios 17 as soon as I get off work,1
125,ios,I didn‚Äôt even installed it. After reading all the negative feedback it seems iOS18 is a backward step.,1
126,ios,Falls short of the hype.,1
127,ios,Magsafe charging is bugged and once the phone hits the charge limit it will start to discharge the phone battery.,1
128,ios,"Another gimmick update that does nothing useful, moves a few features around, throttles performance on older devices and saves all the ‚ÄúApple intelligence‚Äù features for the most recent devices. On iPad it‚Äôs even more lacking. Standard iOS update",-1
129,ios,iOS 18 SUCKS,-1
130,ios,"It has been for a few weeks on beta users. There are some improvements overall but the main aspects like the bad keyboard, having a better alarm/clock system, having a usable Siri and fixing some issues with shortcuts remain.

People are talking about AI but we aren't going to see much of it anytime soon. It's worth the update from iOS 17 of course especially for users in the EU",-1
131,iPhone13Mini,I‚Äôm liking it! Seems smooth for a new install. My phone got pretty hot for the first hour but it‚Äôs ok now. We‚Äôll see about battery drain for the next day. I love rearranging the Home Screen. Haven‚Äôt gotten into the control center yet.,43
132,iPhone13Mini,enjoying iphone mirroring to my mac and rcs messaging with android friends. i thought moving icons around would be the coolest thing but i‚Äôve been on beta since july or whatever and my icons have ended up being exactly the same as before the beta,25
133,iPhone13Mini,It looks like Samsung engineer was hired to lead iOS,11
134,iPhone13Mini,Another Reddit user said it looked like a Samsung galaxy! Idk but yeah kinda androidity! It will take some time to get used to it,9
135,iPhone13Mini,Still can‚Äôt add option to turn on/off location,9
136,iPhone13Mini,"is there option to change the circle back to square? i am not liking it at all, reminds me of android UI which I hate",10
137,iPhone13Mini,"Love the dark app icons. Unlike android themed icons, or iOS tinted, the dark icons retain the logo color (eg Whatsapp Green) on a dark background. Looks great, particularly in dark mode.",7
138,iPhone13Mini,"Surprisingly, it has been pretty smooth for me so far. I love I‚Äôm able to customise control centre!",7
139,iPhone13Mini,I got it too register my non apple battery maximum capacity percentage,13
140,iPhone13Mini,LOVE IT!  Tinted icons have given me the ability to keep the notification bubble but keep my screen colorless without going to full grayscale. The perfect smart dumbphone for me. Otherwise I haven‚Äôt notice much different. I will say for two days so far it seems to sync better with my garmin.,6
141,iPhone13Mini,"For me is being good, no bugs so far, running smoothly",5
142,iPhone13Mini,RCS texting is awesome. Texting my cousins with Samsungs feels snappy and quick. It‚Äôs pretty dope,5
143,iPhone13Mini,The most Android update yet,6
144,iPhone13Mini,"I love it - moved all my icons off the middle of my wallpaper so I can SEE it (yes, I know, it‚Äôs unobstructed on the lock screen, but the Lock Screen is only on for a minute and what‚Äôs the point there?)! 

Haven‚Äôt played with the control center yet, but definitely plan to.

Also love that I no longer have to record a long video and then cut out the parts I don‚Äôt want after it‚Äôs done - so glad that‚Äôs finally available!",5
145,iPhone13Mini,"I didn't need all this control center customization ability to be honest. If they just let me take the Apple TV home widget out and respect my favorited accessories, it would have been fine.",3
146,iPhone13Mini,Its just a new control center,14
147,iPhone13Mini,Switched from android two days ago. Nice to have the customisations I‚Äôm used to.,3
148,iPhone13Mini,It‚Äôs fine,3
149,iPhone13Mini,"i was thinking about moving to the z flip6 or what ever since my battery life is at like 60%

150,iPhone13Mini,I much prefer it this way than the way it was,3
151,iPhone13Mini,"Meh. Now we're able to do what Android has done for years. It looks good, though. But still no adjustable keyboard!",3
152,iPhone13Mini,"I hear RCS messaging isn‚Äôt end to end encrypted due to limitations with the tech. Not impressed on the bait and switch. 

Would have loved a face unlock and PIN unlock combo option for apps and folders",3
153,iPhone13Mini,Meh‚Ä¶,6
154,iPhone13Mini,It‚Äôs whatever. Running smooth so far but it‚Äôs mostly an aesthetic change. I thought I‚Äôd like being able to arrange my home screen however I wanted and I feel like I don‚Äôt know how to and made it look messy. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è but that last part is more of a user defect.,2
155,iPhone13Mini,We can do custom reacts with more emojis on text messages now. Game changer.,2
156,iPhone13Mini,the new control center is kinda laggy for me and battery life seems a little better,2
157,iPhone13Mini,"Well, true, I think it works because we can put this app as we want",2
158,iPhone13Mini,Loving it,2
159,iPhone13Mini,"I haven‚Äôt installed it yet, was waiting for the opinions of you fine gentlemen. It does look really nice. I don‚Äôt usually have much time to bother personalising stuff but i can see myself using a week just for that. Haven‚Äôt used profiles yet although it was a feature i was waiting for some time. I‚Äôm excited about this update",2
160,iPhone13Mini,"Is the flashlight control still the old one? I thought in ios18, they had updated it to control the width of flashlight beam too",2
161,iPhone13Mini,"Its really great actually! Love the new Control Panel, phone seems more snappy and I also think the battery is slightly better?",2
162,iPhone13Mini,I like the more colourful and customizable control centre. Was already great before now better,2
163,iPhone13Mini,"I agree for the keyboard. I was using mine without switching and it was the party each time I was going from french to english. 

So far, no real troubles, customization is quite cool and it runs at least as smoothly as before.

And I will add that it is running so hot that I can cook an egg on the screen ahahahahahahah (a wink for our android friends)",2
164,iPhone13Mini,I prefer it so much more compared to before. Being able to move around my home kit stuff and having it in the same spot everytime compared to before it would move around and have a different function it thought I wanted,2
165,iPhone13Mini,"I heard they removed CarPlay wallpapers, i wonder if they got rid of my favorite all blue one.",2
166,iPhone13Mini,It‚Äôs been good. I‚Äôve been running the developer betas for some time now. Up to beta 4 of iOS 18 and it‚Äôs been very smooth. Much better compared to the 17 roll out. But I have an 15 pro which could be why now versus the 11 than.¬†,2
167,iPhone13Mini,"nothing special, but it has some good new features, like moving the icons where you want",2
168,iPhone13Mini,Seems like all the updates make the 13 mini's faster each time. Mine certainly is. I'm reconsidering my 16 Pro upgrade now.,2
169,iPhone13Mini,We could have just waited tell they came up with something lol feels like they just gave us shit to shut us up  everything new to Apple has been on android for many years,2
170,iPhone13Mini,nothing new i had the beta already if anything final release feels like it has more bugs it feels glitchy compared to beta,2
171,iPhone13Mini,VPN status icon still showing active even when VPN is disconnected,2
172,iPhone13Mini,It‚Äôs like my three year old battery is on caffeine!,2
173,iPhone13Mini,I have definitely used the new Home Screen customization features the most but also am intrigued by the new design of the photos app which was definitely needed,2
174,iPhone13Mini,A mess.,2
175,iPhone13Mini,"So far great! It also strangely feel like the screen wobble got much better? Like, almost pro motion level lol. I dig the new control center and photos app",2
176,iPhone13Mini,"I‚Äôm really starting to notice the 4 gigs of ram, 8 gigs on the 16 is tempting",2
177,iPhone13Mini,I love every single aspect of this update so far‚Ä¶ just not how the new photo app looks and how they separate the password into an app of it own‚Ä¶ seem pointless,2
178,iPhone13Mini,"I‚Äôm just wondering if my 13 could handle this new AI feature in reality, and if Apple is gaslighting us lol",2
179,iPhone13Mini,looks cool,2
180,iPhone13Mini,Nothing all that exciting. Been running the beta for months. It doesn‚Äôt do anything that I find to be particularly useful or notable.,2
181,iPhone13Mini,I have had the iPhone for only 2 years and was a Android user since the G1. I personally feel this is the best compromise between the two platforms. Still have my stability of iOS but now I can customize and switch up things. I haven't considered switching back to Android and don't see that happening after iOS 18.,2
182,iPhone13Mini,I‚Äôve been on it for a while now with the beta releases. Overall happy with it.,2
183,iPhone13Mini,The control center when on landscape is such a mess and I‚Äôve not been able to figure out how to arrange those. Also some controls go missing when on landscape mode!! It‚Äôs super janky!,2
184,iPhone13Mini,I like the large icons option. Less text on the Home Screen looks clean.,2
185,iPhone13Mini,"Would have been nice if they included an ability to customize the order of controls in the connectivity shortcut in control center. Like why am I stuck with airplane mode and airplay as my first 2 options??? Having different pages on control center also feels like overkill, but I guess I see the appeal given just how many shortcuts you can add now. Just seems to clutter things more than convenience imo. Other than that, it‚Äôs fine I guess.

I can‚Äôt say it‚Äôs much like android bc it seems the only android-like features are being able to put your apps anywhere you want on the grid, change widget sizes, and make a couple minor changes on Home Screen details, but that‚Äôs it. It scratches the itch for people who wanted some more customization options, but those from android know that these are very superficial features that android has had for a loooong time",2
186,iPhone13Mini,"I literally see how apple is slowing causing its OS to die.
With all these tons of configuration unnecessarily, its making iPhone just like Android.",2
187,iPhone13Mini,How did you get your control center to be bigger? You don‚Äôt have the little icons on the right side. Hmmm,1
188,iPhone13Mini,So good!!!,1

190,iPhone13Mini,"ios 18 control centre‚Äôs music section :

does touching on one of the covers work? like if i tap on a song from the control centre music section do they play? it is not playing for me. is that normal or is that a me problem?

191,iPhone13Mini,"Has anyone done a full restore and update? My mini is a little laggy, especially after taking a photo.",1

193,iPhone13Mini,"So far so good. Control center is way better and lockscreen shortcuts are cool. 
Haven‚Äôt tested all messages possibilities yet",1
194,iPhone13Mini,I just checked. I can upgrade tot 17.7 but not 18. When was it rolled out?,1
195,iPhone13Mini,No time displayed in control centre is kinda weird.,1
196,iPhone13Mini,Great. Much smoother,1
197,iPhone13Mini,How can I get this??? üëÄ just update the phone and that‚Äôs it?,1
198,iPhone13Mini,"I like it so far, but I kinda dislike the new Safari look and I don't quite understand why we need another app just for passwords when we already had those inside the Settings apps.",1

212,iPhone13Mini,How‚Äôs the battery life? I hope they make a 17mini,1
213,iPhone13Mini,Overall pleased with the update. Dark icons were a big plus for me. I‚Äôm still on the fence about the new Photos app. Not sure what I think about it yet.,1
214,iPhone13Mini,"BUG : on ios18 when u have returned from library apps, the search box background does not disappear on home screen, (on the top right corner its visible) its very annoying and childish bug!",1

218,iPhone13Mini,"I just ABSOLUTELY freaking

think it's utter üí© shit

Random apps crash, giving me a black screen with the white spinning wheel of death, and multiple other people as well.

Individual app security that is based upon the primary unlock security is not any security upgrade at all. If they would allow a different pass code or something, but I have seen some useful features.",1
219,iPhone13Mini,The smoothness??! Really? It's super stuttery.,1

If anything, iOS 18 has fixed some issues I had with my 15 Pro.  Typing / autocorrect accuracy seems noticeably improved to me, and RCS support has significantly improved my messaging with friends who have Android phones.  Not a fan of the new Photos app, it feels like 1 step forward (actual categories for screenshots etc) but 2 steps back (video controls are worse).

Otherwise it's just business as usual, day to day use is pretty much the same as it was before the update.",5
227,ios,The top right pull down menu is a mess. Why is Bluetooth hidden? I had to manually add a Bluetooth icon and everything just shotguns around.,3
228,ios,"For most software I usually wait for the first one or two patch versions. In this case 18.0.1 or 18.0.2. But before 18.1. Apple usually releases their first patch ~1-3 weeks after the major update (17->18) unless there are really bad bugs, then they push hot fixes before then. 

You can check Wikipedia to see if a patch version has been pushed.

There's a few niggles that I just can't get my head around and some stuff that is just downright bad. I honestly can't be bothered to move stuff around on the screens or the control centre because the fluid movement thing gives me a headache trying to work around it.

I like some of it and some of it is stuff I just won't use. The dark icons? Don't care. Being able to place apps wherever I like? Not bothered.

As for the AI stuff, again, I'm just not that interested in it so I don't mind that my 13 won't have it.",2
232,ios,"The new control centre is a nightmare to rearrange and some smaller bugs. My main issue was that my phone kept heating up, which made me downgrade to iOS 17 after being on iOS 18 through the DB5+ betas up until today. My phone never had to stop charging due to overheating on iOS 17 but I understood cos it was the betas. But after almost two weeks on the official version, it was getting annoying cos waiting to lower its temperature made each charging cycle longer.

Also, the connectivity platter is terrible too. Airdrop replacing mobile data and an expand button replacing Bluetooth. Why not keep it the same way? And the buttons are smaller too, with too much empty space between them. I don‚Äôt know, iOS 18 feels kinda cheap. Maybe it will improve, we‚Äôll see.",2

If I open it and start scrolling it‚Äôs like it has a scroll lock or something first that has to be unlocked. Won‚Äôt just start continuously scrolling. Absolute dog shit.",83
271,apple,"I‚Äôve been on the RC, so the big change today has been all the wonderful control center toggle updates from my favorite apps. 

- Things 3
- FocusPomo
- Cardhop

So glad I can finally access features in these from anywhere.",45
272,apple,Can finally hide my ai girlfriend app behind face id,18
273,apple,"RCS isnt working for me despite my carrier info saying it has it and the setting being enabled

edit: it is working for half my android contacts. varying combinations of carriers, all major, and phones",11
274,apple,Just tried updating and it had me choose between 17.7 and 18 on iPhone 15 pro max of course I chose 18,29
275,apple,I hate the new photo app,42
276,apple,"If only it‚Äôd launched with Apple Intelligence it would‚Äôve been one of the most, if not the most, substantial iOS releases ever. But with time it will be. 

So long since we got a major iOS update that isn‚Äôt just a pile of minor, superfluous features and UI changes!",16
277,apple,Bring back the better phone app from early betas!!!,8
278,apple,"It's great that we can move app icons anywhere on the screen now, so why not the same thing for lock screen widgets? It's so frustrating that the 'long' widgets default to being justified to the left. Why can't I center that?",8
279,apple,Still going to stick to one of those transparent widget apps to create my own blank spaces because at least I can stack some hidden widgets,15
280,apple,Anything badass?,21
281,apple,"Superlative speak needs to be cancelled. The most advanced, durable, innovative, thinnest etc is no longer effective and an excuse to make incremental upgrades seem monumental.",65
282,apple,"So, er.. I don't need to update to this shambles based on all the feedback, right.? Right..? I only have security updates set to auto update, not iOS releases.",12
283,apple,"Do you remember when a new iOS version transformed your phone to a whole new one?

Now you‚Äôre like, so did the update work?",25
284,apple,Hey... I though XR would not recieve the update... Now I see it's getting updated! Wowwww.. nice!,16
285,apple,[deleted],32
286,apple,"It's always the ""most personal yet""",62
287,apple,"Install went good.  I recommend a quick reset after install.

Now you can set charge rate between 80-100%.  90% is a sweet compromise to me. So far I like ios 18",13
288,apple,I‚Äôm gonna be honest the UI looks awful. Especially the control center and the photos app. Steve Jobs is rolling over in his grave with this androidification,103
289,apple,How is it that we still do not have the option to sort out photos by file / image size?,12
290,apple,"Where is RCS? I'm in EU and it shows up when searching for ""rcs"" but it's missing in the Messages settings.",8
291,apple,"The most customisable but a huge step back in UX from a company known for their simplicity. 

The amount of overly cluttered default menus and things that now require 2 or more clicks to access is ridiculous. e.g. a screen shot in the photos app now opens to a zoomed out editing page and has to be clicked again to go full screen.",5
292,apple,"RCS working with my Fianc√© and father already, really nice to have receipts, typing indicators and better image handling. My favorite part of the update so far!",4
293,apple,"""iOS 19 is here, and it's Apple's most personal iPhone update yet""",14
294,apple,"Damn. Sitting on an iPhone 12 Pro and wondering if I should even update. The phone will run hotter and shorter on a battery for a weak set of features that I don‚Äôt even fully get in EU.

Oh, Apple. Years back I would upgrade phones almost every year, iOS mandatory every year. What happened? Did I get *so* old?",12
295,apple,They finally gave apps their own alphabetical section in Settings.,7

How do we know RCS is working?",3

300,apple,"I updated from iOS 16 to iOS 17 on Saturday because I knew iOS 18 would release today and now my keyboard is lagging like hell on my iPhone 13 mini. I was avoiding the update for so long because updates always ruin a working system for me (must be you, everything works for me. Dude I just click on update. It's not rocket science there isn't much more to do) and now I regret it. The lagging keyboard is so awful and ruins my iPhone for me. Keyboard is the thing I constantly use.",3
301,apple,"The Photos app update isn't as bad as I was expecting it to be. I'm able to remove all the categories I don't care about and just leave the default and hidden albums. I use the hidden album because it's the only way to truly separate photos on iPhone.

Control Center is better now. I can leave the music controls on the new second page because I don't use it much and I can remove stuff off the first page that I'll never use like Focus. I can also resize icons so they take up more of the screen which looks nicer than a bunch of tiny icons crammed in the top 30% of the screen.

I just wish they didn't remove the Cellular button from the Connection widget and replace it with AirDrop. Not like I disable Cellular often, but it now requires one more click to get to it and in its place is a button I'll never click.",3
302,apple,I have two contacts on Android. How come the text box is different for them? One says my message will be SMS and the other RCS.,3
303,apple,"Is there a good refresher training video on going beyond basics of using iPhone?

There‚Äôs so much iPhones can do that average users are unaware of",3
304,apple,I‚Äôll wait for 18.1,3
305,apple,"2 things. 1. Give me a separate WiFi control on the drop down menu instead of locking it to ""connectivity"". 2. Bring back the original slideshow or give me an option to just have it go from picture to picture, without any music or zooming or cropped pictures. 
Horrible update. I hate it.",3
306,apple,"Getting rid of all the tiny words(app names) on the home screens is so dang nice. Also, *italics* in texting. FINALLY.",3
307,apple,"Can‚Äôt wait for the biggest feature: Apple Intelligence! 

Oh wait.. it‚Äôs not even in beta yet.. guess I‚Äôll go back to using my AirPower charging matt",3

309,apple,"Transcribing voice memos is so nice.  Had an interview, recorded it, sent the transcript to LLM and it spit out a perfect summary of everything.",3
310,apple,"So I was on the public beta for the past few months and when I went to go update, the ‚Äúbeta updates‚Äù was switched to off. Did Apple automatically push me to the normal channel now?",7
311,apple,Is the torch width only on 15 pro and 16s? Because it doesn‚Äôt work on my 15,2

iOS 18 Siri:

‚ÄúYou look lonely, I can fix that.‚Äù",2
318,apple,Seems like an extra click to connect the mobile data. Does anyone know how to switch the icon to place it at the airdrop location.,2
319,apple,"So we can tint icons now, why can‚Äôt we change colors for text messages?!",2
320,apple,Two things that are already driving me insane - the camera roll is clipped off at the bottom with no way to view the latest photos like it was before. Number two is if you're listening to a podcast or music and go to record video it doesn't pause what you're listening to.,2
321,apple,"I hate what they‚Äôve done with photos!!!
I want simple huge icons for all albums! I don‚Äôt need customization. I loved the simple user friendly UI. I don‚Äôt want to spend any time thinking about customizing anything.",2
322,apple,iOS playing catchup with android. When they have no more substantial features to put out they distract with these frivolous ‚Äúcustomization‚Äù features that iOS users had already given up on over a decade ago. Can‚Äôt speak for everyone but I‚Äôm grown so used to the rigid non customizable way of iOS that this new feature seems useless and I don‚Äôt know how it can make my experience better. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è,2
323,apple,"I was optimistic going into this, but I gotta admit I'm feeling very disappointed by this release. Honestly, iOS feels just as messy and awful as android now. I think I'll remember this as the release where apple forgot how to make good software designs. Looking at some of the feedback, from video playback being broken to the awful awful state of the control centre, I hope I'm not alone.",3

328,apple,Will this fix my fucking Air Pod Pros disconnecting randomly even tho my phone is literally 3 feet away,4
329,apple,Trying to install this on my 64 GB iPhone 11 Pro was brutal...,3
330,apple,Moving around an icon or widget still breaks the order I‚Äôm trying to set to my Home Screen. Hope they fix that soon.,3

335,apple,New photos app is actually trash and its not cause I‚Äôm not used to it. It‚Äôs worse in every way. Really hope they revert back once they get feedback,2
336,apple,"Not sure where to go for this but as an Android user the RCS update is fantastic but noticed an issue. Most texts convert immediately but I have a group name on my MMS group chats and when everyone goes to RCS it splits the group into a new group and an old group. iPhone seems to update their current chat with my group name but also starts a new group message. Android side the current group messages becomes the apples new group while the new group becomes apples messages old group. 

Hopefully that came across right. Two group chats. Apple retains the legacy chat and changes the group name to the android users group label. But androids legacy chat ends up being apples newer RCS group chat.

Honestly doesn't bother me much but I assume some people may have gripes about it",2

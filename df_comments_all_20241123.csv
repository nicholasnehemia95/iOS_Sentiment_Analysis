- Battery is still draining pretty fast. I’ll give it a few more days to return to normal. 

- Phone feels a bit slow overall because of how intense the animations are now when you open an app or switch between apps. 

- Keyboard improvements have been amazing. Still not on-par with Android but it’s getting there. 

- I guess the contact cards feature is useful only if all your friends are also on ios 17. So that’ll take a while. 

- Haptics are improved for notifications and when you flip the silent switch. 

- For some reason, selecting all text from anywhere by dragging and holding cursor is no longer working 

- Widget improvements are a bit overhyped. Not finding any of the dynamic widgets useful. 

- Shortcuts and Automations are now much better because now you can assign individual shortcuts to each automations to make them run without your confirmation. This is a huge improvement.

Battery Life: Surprisingly, the battery life seems unchanged so far. I'm yet to notice any significant decrease. It's worth noting that my iPhone is still at 100% capacity after 7 months of use.

Performance: Given that this is the initial release, some occasional hiccups are expected. There are occasional animation stutters, but they're infrequent, much like what I experienced with iOS 16. Everything else remains snappy and responsive. It could be because my phone is just one generation behind, and the performance jump with the 15 Pro processor isn't substantial. After installation, expect some initial slowdowns and animation lag due to background indexing. The real experience starts to shine after at least 24 hours.

Keyboard: The keyboard is fantastic, with no stutters or delays.

Conclusion: While I don't use most of the headline features of iOS 17, I find this original version to be solid.

Battery seems the same on my 12 mini (ie it sucks ass). I updated my contact card, but most of the few people I call use Android.

PROS: 

• haptic touch way faster, similar to 3d touch days; 

• really enjoyed the camera updates, portrait new adjustments, the new heif max format and photos less oversharpened;

• ui overall feels smoother, tho naturally is not as refined as ios 16 (had some ProMotion issues, I’ve experienced frame rate below 30fps); 

• “view credits” page in apple music is nice; 

• FINALLY they fixed the bug where if you opened an app right after closing it, it would crash. now you can reopen apps without being annoyed.

CONS: 

• I know this is an ios 16 thing, but I really hoped they would fix the notifications stutters in ios 17 and I have no idea why it’s taking so long to; 

• more battery drain and overheating compared to ios 16, battery health dropping; 

• having a hard time with the new notifications haptic/sound: I get confused thinking 3rd party apps notifications are message texts and on unmuted it’s too quiet; 

• keyboard predictions/suggestions are okay in english, but it sucks in portuguese; 

• tho I liked the “view credits” in apple music, I don’t know why they put “view full lyrics” inside it. now it’s an extra tap to view them, not as quick access; 

• the new apple music “now playing” ui is cool, but I find it too inconsistent with many of the albums not supporting it yet + some art covers not aligning correctly (also, I miss having some sort of indicative the music is paused other than the little play/pause button).",1,2023-09-21 19:48:18,True,17,NEGATIVE,0.9932536482810974,-0.9932536482810974

The large padding around everything is a bit too much for me. Plus, I really wish they offered separate toggles instead of bundling all the connectivity options together. It would make things a lot easier!

It takes a bit to get used to the new Photos app, but honestly, it’s smoother and finding things is easier. However, I’m not loving the album cards. They’re just too big, but the thumbnails are too small, it’s hard to recognise the images quickly.

I set the new iOS18 wallpaper, set it to 'dynamic' and also for the home screen to mirror the lock screen using the 'pair' option. Often the color on the lockscreen will change, but the color of the homescreen is still stuck on the previous color.

I also sometimes get app icons that don't display properly when apps are in folders. It's just a blank white box. When I click into the folder the app icons will display, but then when I close the folder, it's just a blank white box again. This has happened with quite a few apps.

Mixed feelings on the control center. I like how customizable it is and somewhat like the fact that all the connectivity stuff is on its own page. But then why also have it accessible from the widget thing that defaults to the top left? Why is airplay one of the options there and not cellular data? Yeah i know you can set an icon for cellular data but it's still a strange choice. 

Hate the circles in the control center. Much preferred the rounded-off squares from before.

I’m on the 15pro so can’t wait for the next update with new Siri and AI but in the meantime I haven’t had any issues. Battery was my biggest fear but it actually seems better than before now. Phone hasn’t heated up once like crazy like when I first got the phone and seems to be holding its charge longer. Most of the changes haven’t really been game changer for me personally but I do feel like my phone has been running smoother since the update and somehow texting has gotten better. Before it was messing up everything I was trying to type but now it never does. I’ve been running it for about a day and a half now. Only complaint is the photo library and videos but I’ve never really had that as a vocal part in my usage so it’s whatever to me. I’m sure future updates will tweak things a bit. Control panel was weird at first but after getting rid of some icons and adding new ones it feels the same as before. Calculator has been super fun to use and I’m sure ppl that actually need it for work will take advantage of it to its fullest, especially on iPads and with a pen. I just liked being able to draw 5+5= and getting the answer but even Reddit does that so not exactly groundbreaking haha. 

So for me no complaints, it seems to only have improved my phone and I haven’t had any glitches or lagginess. Even when running battery save mode it barely seemed to make apps or usage suffer like it did before. I ran it hard today with Instacart and DoorDash both running, constantly jumping between apps and opening maps and didn’t have a single problem. Only issue I had was when I went out to the boonies but I blame that on cell reception

This is on a 15pro though so I really can’t comment on people with older models and I’m sure it will make the phone work a bit harder resulting in lagginess or glitches

If it wasn't intentional, it's some incredibly good dumb luck. I've had this problem from back with my iPhone SE 2016 and with an iPhone 14 Pro, and with 3 different AWs, a 6, 7 & Ultra. I had the same issue with every iOS and AW update. It was always one of the 1st thing I'd try after an update just to see lol.

Syncing music would work sometimes, other times it would just sit there, and even when it would work, any albums that would actually sync wouldn't show up in the Music section of the Watch App on my iPhone for what's on the watch. Also every time I opened the music section of the Watch app on my iPhone it would try to sync an album I had long removed my phone, even if I swiped in the app and said to delete it, it would just keeping trying over and over. 

It's still mind numbingly slow, like it took maybe half an hour, or longer to sync 1 album. But the fact it synced it and it's showing up in the album list is somewhat of a miracle.  I don't want to jinx it, but having tried this on 2 phones and 3 watches with like 6 different iOS/watchOS versions, and resetting both the phone and watch numerous times trying to fix it. I'm assuming it works now.  I gave up trying after about 50 attempts, it's never worked like this for me. I just tried today for shits and giggles to see what would happen.


Now I don't believe Apple cared at all, this probably wasn't something they purpously fixed.  So I hope it doesn't break again with something they change in the next update lol.  It would be nice is if it was I dunno, faster than dial up modem speeds, but it I let it run for a few days I'll have the music on the watch.

Most texts convert immediately but I have a group name on my MMS group chats and when everyone goes to RCS it splits the group into a new group and an old group. iPhone seems to update their current chat with my group name but also starts a new group message. Android side the current group messages becomes the apples new group while the new group becomes apples messages old group. 

Hopefully that came across right. Two group chats. Apple retains the legacy chat and changes the group name to the android users group label. But androids legacy chat ends up being apples newer RCS group chat.

Honestly doesn't bother me much but I assume some people may have gripes about it",2,2024-09-16 23:00:26,True,18,NEGATIVE,0.9944763779640198,-0.9944763779640198

Also, I can’t find the actual memoji anywhere… I see where it’s listed in the +, but all that’s there is the ANIMOJI. 

I also prefer to have my most used things above the keyboard like before with the + used for overflow… maybe a widget could be created to allow us to do that. The + adds a lot of time. I can’t quickly access photos or gifs or my camera or my memojis or my most used stickers packs. 

I also cannot access my ALBUMS in PHOTOS when I go through the + in iMessage. 

Also, when using SAFARI now, when I open a new window, I’m not getting a keyboard to type my search words…

I HATE this. I use my phone mostly for texting. The + change basically breaks half of imessages functionality for me. Nothing is fast or intuitive. I have to move my hand far away from the keyboard and look through a menu. It sucks.

I have iPhone 14 Pro for about 9 months now.
Last week I updated my phone to new IOS.
The day after, when I call someone or let’s say if someone calls me , after 30 seconds or max 1 minutes they wont be able to hear me.
So I thought maybe there is a problem with me sim card.( I bought a new sim card but It did not fix the problem)

Even when I make a call with whatsapp or Facetime Audio, I have the same problem…

Battery Life: Surprisingly, the battery life seems unchanged so far. I'm yet to notice any significant decrease. It's worth noting that my iPhone is still at 100% capacity after 7 months of use.

Performance: Given that this is the initial release, some occasional hiccups are expected. There are occasional animation stutters, but they're infrequent, much like what I experienced with iOS 16. Everything else remains snappy and responsive. It could be because my phone is just one generation behind, and the performance jump with the 15 Pro processor isn't substantial. After installation, expect some initial slowdowns and animation lag due to background indexing. The real experience starts to shine after at least 24 hours.

Keyboard: The keyboard is fantastic, with no stutters or delays.

On the iPhone, the keyboard deciding to be in the middle of the screen instead of at the bottom (out on my iPad, not showing up at all on the Lock Screen. Caused many iOS versions ago), Music not being about to skip to the previous track, the Lock Screen not loading properly but instead showing what’s behind it, the Music app leaving album art behind on the Lock Screen after removing the controls. Stuff like that which removes the polish

Notification centre animations are still broken. They glitch out some times, which has been a consistent thing in iOS 16. There’s also lag in a number of animations

default notification tone - changed without my permission or knowledge. This is more of a complaint than a concern for me. Super irritating.

Phone call experience - Large gray screen when on a call with a known contact. Thats weird. 

Battery - draining super fast. Indexing likely the culprit, but that cannot be verified.

PROS: 

• haptic touch way faster, similar to 3d touch days; 

• really enjoyed the camera updates, portrait new adjustments, the new heif max format and photos less oversharpened;

• ui overall feels smoother, tho naturally is not as refined as ios 16 (had some ProMotion issues, I’ve experienced frame rate below 30fps); 

• “view credits” page in apple music is nice; 

• FINALLY they fixed the bug where if you opened an app right after closing it, it would crash. now you can reopen apps without being annoyed.

CONS: 

• I know this is an ios 16 thing, but I really hoped they would fix the notifications stutters in ios 17 and I have no idea why it’s taking so long to; 

• more battery drain and overheating compared to ios 16, battery health dropping; 

• having a hard time with the new notifications haptic/sound: I get confused thinking 3rd party apps notifications are message texts and on unmuted it’s too quiet; 

• keyboard predictions/suggestions are okay in english, but it sucks in portuguese; 

• tho I liked the “view credits” in apple music, I don’t know why they put “view full lyrics” inside it. now it’s an extra tap to view them, not as quick access;

So when I go to bed I can just swipe to control centre and tap a couple of buttons to turn the couple of lamps off that I’ve been using downstairs.

On the other side of it. I usually have living room set to 40 when tapping the icon it used to put it on at 40.

I set the new iOS18 wallpaper, set it to 'dynamic' and also for the home screen to mirror the lock screen using the 'pair' option. Often the color on the lockscreen will change, but the color of the homescreen is still stuck on the previous color.

I also sometimes get app icons that don't display properly when apps are in folders. It's just a blank white box. When I click into the folder the app icons will display, but then when I close the folder, it's just a blank white box again. This has happened with quite a few apps.

Mixed feelings on the control center. I like how customizable it is and somewhat like the fact that all the connectivity stuff is on its own page. But then why also have it accessible from the widget thing that defaults to the top left? Why is airplay one of the options there and not cellular data? Yeah i know you can set an icon for cellular data but it's still a strange choice. 

Hate the circles in the control center. Much preferred the rounded-off squares from before.

Calendar: I like it. I understand iPhone has a small screen, but displaying items as a freaking dot was so stupid, now I am able to see some texts and how many tasks on that day.

Phone mirroring: Not sure if I should put it here since It's working on MacOS, but It's garbage, super stupid to resize the window, lagging, not friendly with regular good old mouse. It looks like Apple was overly paranoid on the displaying quality, it looks sharp and cool, but unusable.

Pushing notification to Mac: Nice, I like it.

I’m on the 15pro so can’t wait for the next update with new Siri and AI but in the meantime I haven’t had any issues. Battery was my biggest fear but it actually seems better than before now. Phone hasn’t heated up once like crazy like when I first got the phone and seems to be holding its charge longer. Most of the changes haven’t really been game changer for me personally but I do feel like my phone has been running smoother since the update and somehow texting has gotten better. Before it was messing up everything I was trying to type but now it never does. I’ve been running it for about a day and a half now. Only complaint is the photo library and videos but I’ve never really had that as a vocal part in my usage so it’s whatever to me. I’m sure future updates will tweak things a bit. Control panel was weird at first but after getting rid of some icons and adding new ones it feels the same as before. Calculator has been super fun to use and I’m sure ppl that actually need it for work will take advantage of it to its fullest, especially on iPads and with a pen. I just liked being able to draw 5+5= and getting the answer but even Reddit does that so not exactly groundbreaking haha. 

So for me no complaints, it seems to only have improved my phone and I haven’t had any glitches or lagginess. Even when running battery save mode it barely seemed to make apps or usage suffer like it did before. I ran it hard today with Instacart and DoorDash both running, constantly jumping between apps and opening maps and didn’t have a single problem. Only issue I had was when I went out to the boonies but I blame that on cell reception

This is on a 15pro though so I really can’t comment on people with older models and I’m sure it will make the phone work a bit harder resulting in lagginess or glitches

If it wasn't intentional, it's some incredibly good dumb luck. I've had this problem from back with my iPhone SE 2016 and with an iPhone 14 Pro, and with 3 different AWs, a 6, 7 & Ultra. I had the same issue with every iOS and AW update. It was always one of the 1st thing I'd try after an update just to see lol.

Syncing music would work sometimes, other times it would just sit there, and even when it would work, any albums that would actually sync wouldn't show up in the Music section of the Watch App on my iPhone for what's on the watch. Also every time I opened the music section of the Watch app on my iPhone it would try to sync an album I had long removed my phone, even if I swiped in the app and said to delete it, it would just keeping trying over and over. 

It's still mind numbingly slow, like it took maybe half an hour, or longer to sync 1 album. But the fact it synced it and it's showing up in the album list is somewhat of a miracle.  I don't want to jinx it, but having tried this on 2 phones and 3 watches with like 6 different iOS/watchOS versions, and resetting both the phone and watch numerous times trying to fix it. I'm assuming it works now.  I gave up trying after about 50 attempts, it's never worked like this for me. I just tried today for shits and giggles to see what would happen.


Now I don't believe Apple cared at all, this probably wasn't something they purpously fixed.  So I hope it doesn't break again with something they change in the next update lol.  It would be nice is if it was I dunno, faster than dial up modem speeds, but it I let it run for a few days I'll have the music on the watch.

I like some of it and some of it is stuff I just won't use. The dark icons? Don't care. Being able to place apps wherever I like? Not bothered.

My phone never had to stop charging due to overheating on iOS 17 but I understood cos it was the betas. But after almost two weeks on the official version, it was getting annoying cos waiting to lower its temperature made each charging cycle longer.

Also, the connectivity platter is terrible too. Airdrop replacing mobile data and an expand button replacing Bluetooth. Why not keep it the same way?

It feels like they decided that the larger preview is going to be the main way of playing videos now and designed around that. To be fair I partially understand since going into full screen is barely larger than the preview now and it’s a much more seamless experience zooming into the video. It even has a soft snap to zoom into a size that fills the entire screen.

That’s flat out never going to happen. Apple has been using and improving on their own font for years now, and is incredibly unlikely to allow people to switch away from that to whatever font they want….it would break so many things surrounding the UI for starters.

Reference my earlier point about fonts. Apple does technically support individual apps being able to change their icons already but I have a hard time seeing them adding a “launcher” system like Android has for several reasons.

Pair that with 

-	no dark mode support
-	and if you want to customize the Home Screen you either get to use the same photo, a color/gradient, or one of your own images. You can’t mix and match THEIR wallpapers to make, say, the earth on the Lock Screen and moon on the Home Screen.

I feel like at this moment I’d much rather have these new notifications features (notifications at the bottom) and the old style light/dark wallpapers. The cutouts are *neat*, but not neat enough to warrant taking away the fun things we had before.

My other phone still on 14 allows me to select different types of health info and behaves normally when editing or creating a Shortcut, but in iOS 15, none of the health-related fields react when tapped. I can change the filtering, units, grouping, sorting, and limit, but I cannot change the type of data (sleep duration, heart rate, etc. …). It acts like I am not tapping the blue field for “type”, but it does honor changes to Shortcuts made on my iOS 14 phone.

-	I rebooted the iOS 15 phone.
-	I deleted and re-installed Shortcuts on the iOS 15 phone to no avail.
-	“Find Health Samples” does not ask to allow access to the health data types, but if I do a Shortcut to “Log Health Sample”, it does, and I can allow reading and/or writing.
-	Using Log, I did allow access for Shortcuts to the data types I was attempting to use in Find.

Does anyone have a good recommendation for this? I can't imagine what I'm looking to do is uncommon, but I haven't found any solutions yet. 

Essentially there are a handful of apps (Slack, outlook, etc) that I only want to receive notifications for M-F 9-5 without having to toggle each one manually each time. Scheduled summaries and focus seemed promising, but had the follow issues:

Scheduled Summary - Only has time options, but no days and no scheduled/unscheduled mix. I'd love if there were a way to set up a schedule such that Outlook + other work apps summary came at 9AM, notifications functioned normally through 5PM, and anything after 5 would show at the next day's 9AM summary. 

Focus - I was hoping this could filter OUT certain apps/people, but it seems focus can only set up apps and contacts to allow. If there was a way to allow ALL apps/contacts at once, then remove some, this could seemingly accomplish what I'm looking for, but for now it's essentially useless as I prefer to filter out small subsets of notifications instead of allowing small subsets.

So I decided to try ios 15 bèta, I installed ios 15 bèta 2 and the phone ran smooth I noticed it was even better than ios 14. The battery life was great. 

So after ios official released I upgraded to the official version through a clean install. Everything seems okay until my phone dropped under the 10% battery than the problems began. Suddenly my phone was unresponsive the touchscreen wasn't responding on swiping and every application opened slowly and I almost couldn't scroll through the settings list. 

Restarted the phone but that didn't make a difference,  eventually the phone died and I hooked up to charge. When the phone started everything was working fine again screen was responding again. 

Strange things is that this didn't happened when I was on the ios bèta. 

Anyone has experienced something similar?

I'm going to see if it happens again when I let my battery drop under the 10% .",1,2021-09-28 10:56:54,True,15,NEGATIVE,0.9565961956977844,-0.9565961956977844

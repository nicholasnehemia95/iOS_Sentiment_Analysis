Is it adjustable in any way? Brightness? Why do I apparently have to be in the dark to configure this shit? 

I've had Mail refuse to load previews at least twice now, both in the notifications and within the app itself. Had to kill Mail both times to fix it. 

The contacts posters are ... I have no idea--confusing, buggy. Some pics and configs stick, some don't, and who know when or why for any of it. 

Battery life seems roughly the same. 

Initially FaceID seemed faster, but there's a weird lag now after a couple days. 

Overall, apps seem a bit slower to load. The phone is constantly asking me if I'm driving now before it unlocks, even if I'm nowhere near a car, completely disconnected from CarPlay. Even that happens somewhat randomly.

This was all before the .0.1 update. I'm in a 12 Pro Max, fwiw.

Even with reading glasses, this Gen X girl cannot see the sticker pack icons well enough. I say this with a 13 pro max- I can’t imagine on a smallef phone. 

Also, I can’t find the actual memoji anywhere… I see where it’s listed in the +, but all that’s there is the ANIMOJI. 

I also prefer to have my most used things above the keyboard like before with the + used for overflow… maybe a widget could be created to allow us to do that. The + adds a lot of time. I can’t quickly access photos or gifs or my camera or my memojis or my most used stickers packs. 

I also cannot access my ALBUMS in PHOTOS when I go through the + in iMessage. 

Also, when using SAFARI now, when I open a new window, I’m not getting a keyboard to type my search words…

I HATE this. I use my phone mostly for texting. The + change basically breaks half of imessages functionality for me. Nothing is fast or intuitive. I have to move my hand far away from the keyboard and look through a menu. It sucks.

I have iPhone 14 Pro for about 9 months now.
Last week I updated my phone to new IOS.
The day after, when I call someone or let’s say if someone calls me , after 30 seconds or max 1 minutes they wont be able to hear me.

Battery Life: Surprisingly, the battery life seems unchanged so far. I'm yet to notice any significant decrease. It's worth noting that my iPhone is still at 100% capacity after 7 months of use.

Performance: Given that this is the initial release, some occasional hiccups are expected. There are occasional animation stutters, but they're infrequent, much like what I experienced with iOS 16. Everything else remains snappy and responsive. It could be because my phone is just one generation behind, and the performance jump with the 15 Pro processor isn't substantial. After installation, expect some initial slowdowns and animation lag due to background indexing. The real experience starts to shine after at least 24 hours.

Keyboard: The keyboard is fantastic, with no stutters or delays.

Conclusion: While I don't use most of the headline features of iOS 17, I find this original version to be solid. Compared to previous iOS releases, which were often problematic, it seems like Apple has learned from its past mistakes.",2,POSITIVE,0.9962732791900635,2023-09-20 17:16:17,,,,,,,17

On the iPhone, the keyboard deciding to be in the middle of the screen instead of at the bottom (out on my iPad, not showing up at all on the Lock Screen. Caused many iOS versions ago), Music not being about to skip to the previous track, the Lock Screen not loading properly but instead showing what’s behind it, the Music app leaving album art behind on the Lock Screen after removing the controls.

PROS: 

• haptic touch way faster, similar to 3d touch days; 

• really enjoyed the camera updates, portrait new adjustments, the new heif max format and photos less oversharpened;

• ui overall feels smoother, tho naturally is not as refined as ios 16 (had some ProMotion issues, I’ve experienced frame rate below 30fps); 

• “view credits” page in apple music is nice; 

• FINALLY they fixed the bug where if you opened an app right after closing it, it would crash. now you can reopen apps without being annoyed.

CONS: 

• I know this is an ios 16 thing, but I really hoped they would fix the notifications stutters in ios 17 and I have no idea why it’s taking so long to; 

• more battery drain and overheating compared to ios 16, battery health dropping; 

• having a hard time with the new notifications haptic/sound: I get confused thinking 3rd party apps notifications are message texts and on unmuted it’s too quiet; 

• keyboard predictions/suggestions are okay in english, but it sucks in portuguese; 

• tho I liked the “view credits” in apple music, I don’t know why they put “view full lyrics” inside it. now it’s an extra tap to view them, not as quick access; 

• the new apple music “now playing” ui is cool, but I find it too inconsistent with many of the albums not supporting it yet + some art covers not aligning correctly (also, I miss having some sort of indicative the music is paused other than the little play/pause button).",1,NEGATIVE,-0.9932536482810974,2023-09-21 19:48:18,,,,,,,17

Use the control centre to turn the lights off around the house - because I don’t like leaving them on and I don’t go to bed at a set time each day.

So when I go to bed I can just swipe to control centre and tap a couple of buttons to turn the couple of lamps off that I’ve been using downstairs.

On the other side of it. I usually have living room set to 40 when tapping the icon it used to put it on at 40.

Photo: I haven't got used to it, I think I need to spend some time on the customization. I still need to scroll down down down even after getting used to it. One big plus thing is the picture fitting, remember the buttons and info covering the picture? Not anymore, the picture will fit the viewable area and it looks great.

Calendar: I like it. I understand iPhone has a small screen, but displaying items as a freaking dot was so stupid, now I am able to see some texts and how many tasks on that day.

Phone mirroring: Not sure if I should put it here since It's working on MacOS, but It's garbage, super stupid to resize the window, lagging, not friendly with regular good old mouse. It looks like Apple was overly paranoid on the displaying quality, it looks sharp and cool, but unusable.

Pushing notification to Mac: Nice, I like it.

swipe down menu: trash. Photo requires a lot of customization, this menu provided too limited customization tolerance.... I like AirDrop, but why do I need an AirDrop button out up there?

I’m on the 15pro so can’t wait for the next update with new Siri and AI but in the meantime I haven’t had any issues. Battery was my biggest fear but it actually seems better than before now. Phone hasn’t heated up once like crazy like when I first got the phone and seems to be holding its charge longer. Most of the changes haven’t really been game changer for me personally but I do feel like my phone has been running smoother since the update and somehow texting has gotten better. Before it was messing up everything I was trying to type but now it never does. I’ve been running it for about a day and a half now. Only complaint is the photo library and videos but I’ve never really had that as a vocal part in my usage so it’s whatever to me. I’m sure future updates will tweak things a bit. Control panel was weird at first but after getting rid of some icons and adding new ones it feels the same as before. Calculator has been super fun to use and I’m sure ppl that actually need it for work will take advantage of it to its fullest, especially on iPads and with a pen. I just liked being able to draw 5+5= and getting the answer but even Reddit does that so not exactly groundbreaking haha. 

So for me no complaints, it seems to only have improved my phone and I haven’t had any glitches or lagginess. Even when running battery save mode it barely seemed to make apps or usage suffer like it did before. I ran it hard today with Instacart and DoorDash both running, constantly jumping between apps and opening maps and didn’t have a single problem. Only issue I had was when I went out to the boonies but I blame that on cell reception

This is on a 15pro though so I really can’t comment on people with older models and I’m sure it will make the phone work a bit harder resulting in lagginess or glitches 

PS. I’m pissed that they added the Shazam shortcut to the action button because I was so proud of myself for making a custom command to use Shazam and told all my friends to use the action button for it haha but great to see it was added in the update",2,NEGATIVE,-0.9911758899688721,2024-09-19 01:19:04,,,,,,,18

Also the multipage thing that is going on is not perfect yet. Page symbols (for example the favorites heart switches pages when you add icons on the page above - can’t replicate it now, but it was weird somehow)

If it wasn't intentional, it's some incredibly good dumb luck. I've had this problem from back with my iPhone SE 2016 and with an iPhone 14 Pro, and with 3 different AWs, a 6, 7 & Ultra. I had the same issue with every iOS and AW update. It was always one of the 1st thing I'd try after an update just to see lol.

Syncing music would work sometimes, other times it would just sit there, and even when it would work, any albums that would actually sync wouldn't show up in the Music section of the Watch App on my iPhone for what's on the watch. Also every time I opened the music section of the Watch app on my iPhone it would try to sync an album I had long removed my phone, even if I swiped in the app and said to delete it, it would just keeping trying over and over. 

It's still mind numbingly slow, like it took maybe half an hour, or longer to sync 1 album. But the fact it synced it and it's showing up in the album list is somewhat of a miracle.  I don't want to jinx it, but having tried this on 2 phones and 3 watches with like 6 different iOS/watchOS versions, and resetting both the phone and watch numerous times trying to fix it. I'm assuming it works now.  I gave up trying after about 50 attempts, it's never worked like this for me. I just tried today for shits and giggles to see what would happen.


Now I don't believe Apple cared at all, this probably wasn't something they purpously fixed.  So I hope it doesn't break again with something they change in the next update lol.  It would be nice is if it was I dunno, faster than dial up modem speeds, but it I let it run for a few days I'll have the music on the watch. I remember reading somewhere they limit the music on the watch to 8GB so I can't put too much anywho.

If anyone actually read this and is wondering what exactly I'm talking about, it's all music I synced to my phone with iTunes on my PC.",1,NEGATIVE,-0.9564172029495239,2024-10-12 22:24:41,,,,,,,18

Typing / autocorrect accuracy seems noticeably improved to me, and RCS support has significantly improved my messaging with friends who have Android phones.

As long as you zoom in from the preview it will allow you to scrub back and forth.  

 I agree it’s stupid to not be able to do basic video scrolling when in full screen but there is a work around for you I found with a couple of seconds of playing around with a video. 

It feels like they decided that the larger preview is going to be the main way of playing videos now and designed around that. To be fair I partially understand since going into full screen is barely larger than the preview now and it’s a much more seamless experience zooming into the video. It even has a soft snap to zoom into a size that fills the entire screen. 

They could have kept controls in full screen though. ",21.0,NEGATIVE,2024-09-16 17:09:00,-0.9453939199447632,18

I just wish they didn't remove the Cellular button from the Connection widget and replace it with AirDrop. Not like I disable Cellular often, but it now requires one more click to get to it and in its place is a button I'll never click.",3,NEGATIVE,-0.998038113117218,2024-09-16 16:37:08,,,,,,,18

1. Screenshot your current wallpaper at the Lock Screen.

That’s flat out never going to happen. Apple has been using and improving on their own font for years now, and is incredibly unlikely to allow people to switch away from that to whatever font they want….it would break so many things surrounding the UI for starters.

>changeable icons 

Reference my earlier point about fonts. Apple does technically support individual apps being able to change their icons already but I have a hard time seeing them adding a “launcher” system like Android has for several reasons.

That said, the new seek UI is excellent; just tap and hold anywhere on screen and drag, with a preview of where you’re going to end up as you scroll. Really good stuff here",5,POSITIVE,0.9990768432617188,2022-09-12 20:01:52,,,,,,,16

Tl;dr: They made the address bar easier to reach but the open tabs harder to reach.",57,NEGATIVE,-0.9977623224258423,2021-09-20 16:58:19,he6uh2e,"Agree with that. I would love to have an option to easily close tabs as before without using two hands. I don’t know why they change that. Instead one column with tabs, now I got two and the first one from the left side is barely accessible.

My other phone still on 14 allows me to select different types of health info and behaves normally when editing or creating a Shortcut, but in iOS 15, none of the health-related fields react when tapped. I can change the filtering, units, grouping, sorting, and limit, but I cannot change the type of data (sleep duration, heart rate, etc. …). It acts like I am not tapping the blue field for “type”, but it does honor changes to Shortcuts made on my iOS 14 phone. I haven’t found any other Shortcut editing/creating problems, but I haven’t done an exhaustive check.

-	I rebooted the iOS 15 phone.
-	I deleted and re-installed Shortcuts on the iOS 15 phone to no avail.
-	“Find Health Samples” does not ask to allow access to the health data types, but if I do a Shortcut to “Log Health Sample”, it does, and I can allow reading and/or writing.
-	Using Log, I did allow access for Shortcuts to the data types I was attempting to use in Find.

Does anyone have a good recommendation for this? I can't imagine what I'm looking to do is uncommon, but I haven't found any solutions yet. 

Essentially there are a handful of apps (Slack, outlook, etc) that I only want to receive notifications for M-F 9-5 without having to toggle each one manually each time. Scheduled summaries and focus seemed promising, but had the follow issues:

Scheduled Summary - Only has time options, but no days and no scheduled/unscheduled mix. I'd love if there were a way to set up a schedule such that Outlook + other work apps summary came at 9AM, notifications functioned normally through 5PM, and anything after 5 would show at the next day's 9AM summary. 

Focus - I was hoping this could filter OUT certain apps/people, but it seems focus can only set up apps and contacts to allow. If there was a way to allow ALL apps/contacts at once, then remove some, this could seemingly accomplish what I'm looking for, but for now it's essentially useless as I prefer to filter out small subsets of notifications instead of allowing small subsets. 

If anyone has a solution I'd really love to hear it! I hope I'm just missing something.",1,NEGATIVE,-0.9996833801269531,2021-09-24 15:09:23,,,,,,,15

In todayâ€™s age, many individuals express the opinions of current events using various social
media platforms. In our final project assignment, we will utilize social media, specifically
Reddit, to gather comments from posts discussing iOS 15, 16, 17 and 18 upgrades, and
conduct a sentiment analysis based on the comments and replies found.

Definitions for each file: \
urlLIST15.csv, urlLIST16.csv, urlLIST17.csv, urlLIST18.csv - urls of reddit posts used for data gathering \
WebScrapingNotebookFinal.ipynb - code to gather and transform Reddit comments \
WordCounts.ipynb - code to compile word count from all comments \
df_comments_all.csv - comment data prior to transformation \
SentimentAnalysis_Comments.csv - after transformation; file used in Tableau Workbook for commment analysis \
